title: About
---

I'm a clinical research coordinator at the University of California, San Francisco, working in our neurology department's Memory and Aging Center. Currently ensuring my lab runs smoothly and working on data analysis & visualization (R), experiment creation (Qualtrics, Javascript, E-Prime), and a few manuscripts! 

My research experience provides me with a background in data collection and analysis in EEG/ERPs and eye-tracking during my time as an undergrad working on attention, semantic and syntactic processing, and visual working memory. Following undergrad, I gained clinical experience as a psychometrist, where I administered an array of cognitive batteries to patients with cognitive deficits. I'm currently using my combination of experience and interests to explore decision-making in clinical populations with dementia using behavioral economic paradigms and (f)MRI. 

I'm focused on learning more about data science and sharpening my technical skills. Enrolled in [Metis' Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com).
