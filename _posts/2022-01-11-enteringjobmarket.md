title: Entering the job market!
---

Well, things are happening quickly! I met with my PI yesterday and told him I'd be applying to the new positions-the prospect of leaving the lab is quite bittersweet. I'm excited to move to get my hands dirty in data science, but the culture I have in the lab is extraordinary. I've been transparent with this whole process, and Winston's been more than supportive, so I'm happy I get to ensure I leave them in a good place. 

I've been networking more than I thought I would've thus far, so I'll need to start preparing more for technical interviews. The book I got, *Ace the Data Science Interview*, will be handy for this. I also got to help out Prathap with his blog; [pluggin his blog here](https://prathapr91.github.io/). Glad we can help each other out and share resources since the flex Bootcamp seemed a little disconnected from our peers.
