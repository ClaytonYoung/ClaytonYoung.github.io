I've been toying around with ideas for my first EDA project using the MTA data found [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). For now, I've decided that my 'client' is a small business owner looking to capitalize on the exiting foot traffic coming from the MTA stations. First, I'll need find which station has the hightest amount of exiting foot traffic, along with which days of the week and times are the busiest.
