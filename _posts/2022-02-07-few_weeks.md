One of the biggest takeaways from being in the lab is asking myself: what am I uniquely positioned to do?

An instructor at Metis described our preparedness to enter the vast field of Data Science as "dangerous enough to have an impact." Entering a mid-senior level market as someone freshly transitioning, I've reflected on what I can offer in my next role. 

I feel confident I'll be able to leverage what I've learned in Data Science to make an impact as either a data scientist or data analyst. To show, I have my DS portfolio, and despite being recently turned down for a DA role at an outstanding company in favor of someone with more experience, I received the feedback:

"Wanted to let you know that feedback from your offline exercise came back great! It was actually one of the better ones we've ever reviewed. "

Taking the rejection in stride, I completed the DA certification through DataCamp (now just awaiting my video presentation grade). After that, however, I began thinking more about the day-to-day differences between DSxDAxDE. As a result, I feel data engineering might be a good fit because the organizational, supportive nature of the role fits not only my interests but how I've seen myself within different organizations and teamsâ€“I function the best serving, supporting, and creating so that others can perform optimally. I've already developed a strong sense of DA and DS roles, so strengthening my DE skills (databases, SQL, and pipelines) will only benefit me in my next post, regardless of the title.
