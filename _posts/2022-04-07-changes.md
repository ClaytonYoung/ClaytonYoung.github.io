Since my last post, I've accepted a position at UCSF's Memory and Aging Center as a Data Engineer! I didn’t expect I'd be staying at UCSF when I began 
my job search, but I feel at home here, and I'm pleased to continue contributing to a meaningful purpose alongside the best in the world. I've also found an
apartment in Atlanta, so I'll be moving there at the end of the month. I'm excited but mournful about leaving SF, California, my friends, and my lab mates.

This feels right–the role matches how I view myself, what I think I can contribute, and what I want for my future. My lifestyle, finances, and, more importantly,
my relationship will all benefit from moving to Atlanta.

I'm so grateful for these past few years here in San Francisco. I didn't think I'd enjoy it here, but I feel like it's my home and that I've grown into myself, 
not to mention that I've met some of my best friends here. 

Man. I'm going to miss this chapter, and that's a great thing! I feel like moving at this time when it's difficult is a good sign–I had a convo with Winston about this,
and the opposite is a terrible sign. I'm ready for the next chapter but don't **only** feel relief from my departure.
