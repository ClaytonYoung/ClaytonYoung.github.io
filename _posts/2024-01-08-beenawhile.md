I'll try to just write and not think too much about it or feed my thoughts into an LLM. 

Guess my intention of keeping this updated was just that–an intention. I get a little in my head about what I should actually post here. It's easy to keep my head down and keep working on stuff without writing about it here. I also don't know how personal I should keep this. I have my Obsidian notes for personal stuff, but if anyone wants to see my thoughts, I guess this would be a good place to put them. Maybe like an OG Facebook or Twitter. 

More changes from last post. A lot. Madhu and I are engaged and we have a lovely little puppy, Delfina (she's two now), that we've brought back with us to the Bay Area. We're in Oakland now. I left UCSF a few months back–I was ready for a new challenge and knew it was time to leave. I linked up with Jesse in 2023 after seeing he left UCSF to start a company and asked if I could help him build. We have a working product now. Things are all very serendipitous. I'm excited to start exploring what other opportunities are out there. Think it'll be a lot of talking to people and finding something that sounds interesting. I don't have a strong sense of the exact position, but continuing to look inward wont get me much further.
