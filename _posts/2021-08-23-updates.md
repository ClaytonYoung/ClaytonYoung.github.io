So, I've finished my project on where a food truck should stop in the Bronx to maximize potential sales. the writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/blob/master/assets/Metis/EDA/EDA_project_writeup_Clayton_Young.ipynb)<p></p>

My next project will have something to do with Liverpool FC, which I'm excited about. I've thought this past weekend about creating a logistic regression predicting which player receive a song/chant from the Kop :D
