This year has been a lot of fun, and I'm thankful for having been out of the country for the first time (albeit during COVID)! 
I also completed the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/bootcamps/online-data-science-bootcamp) Bootcamp, which was the main reason for starting the whole blog thing!

I feel a lot of momentum at the moment. I've spent the holidays cleaning and analyzing my metacognition project for the lab so I can wrap things up! I've found myself intrigued by the movements in tech at the moment surrounding crypto. It could very well be an internet fad, but I'm having a hard time ignoring the movements in that realm. I used some of my unsupervised NLP project findings and invested in Algorand. Seems like an exciting project with a lot of positive sentiment surrounding it! Also, the metacognition project I'm working on was pioneered in part by Hakwan Lau, a professor at UCLA and part of the [Harmony One](https://harmony.one/team/) crypto protocol! Also, see some familiar faces in work on metacognition, like Christof Koch. 

Anyway, not sure what route I'll end up going this next year, but I'm excited to have learned a lot in 2021 and want to join a team to continue learning and growing.
