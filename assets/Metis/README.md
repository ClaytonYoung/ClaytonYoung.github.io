Title: Data science projects

This is where I'm hosting my data science projects I completed while at Metis. Within each folder, you should find a notebook, presentation slides, and a project writeup, as well as any ancillary files/folders. Thanks for visiting!

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/assets/Metis/EDA)
- Analyzed New York MTA data for a hypothetical taco truck business. The insights drawn from here allowed me to create a weekly calendar to capitalize on exiting foot traffic. 

### [Web scraping and Linear Regression](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/assets/Metis/Regression)
- For this project, I used Selenium to scrape a few different sites to predict the number of goals a player would score in a premier league season. Really fun project. Though, I wouldn't use linear regression for this type of problem in the future!

### [Business](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/assets/Metis/Business)
- Explored heart disease using the CDC's NHIS data. My presentations benefitted from this module! I also used Tableau in a really neat way by integrating a video clip of me navigating the dashboard I created.

### [Classification](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/assets/Metis/Classification)
- Using UCSF's Memory and Aging data (where I work),  I wanted to build a dementia classification model. I built a few different models and tuned their hyperparameters using grid and randomized search cross-validation. This was a great real-world problem, and I'm lucky to have been able to use the data from work!

### [Unsupervised Learning and NLP](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/assets/Metis/Classification)
- Used unsupervised learning to topic model Reddit comments from r/CryptoCurrency to see what's going on in an area that has a lot of traction at the moment. This was probably the most exciting one of the lot for me since I found myself scrolling through Reddit while sick when trying to come up with project ideas.
