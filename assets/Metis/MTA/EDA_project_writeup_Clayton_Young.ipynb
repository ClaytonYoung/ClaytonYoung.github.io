    "One of this dataset's strengths is our ability to see where and when people are entering and exiting each MTA station. Therefore, I thought to utilize this data to increase potential sales by capitalizing on exiting foot traffic on different days at different times. Specifically, I wanted to build a food truck stop schedule informed by finding the highest average exiting foot traffic by week, day, and hour in the Bronx. After cleaning my data and thinking about how best to approach this problem, I created plots for each day of the week that informed the schedule created for my client. "

    "A Bronx-based food truck owner wants to increase potential sales by capitalizing on [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). The metric of interest is the exiting foot traffic in the Bronx [(because, well, who wants to eat when they're *on* the subway?)](https://www.thedailymeal.com/eating-subway-gross-or-no-big-deal). Since the only restriction to Bronx mobile food vendors is *only* [one street,](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/rules-regs-mfv.pdf) my client can move about the Bronx freely, targeting any station to increase potential sales. We opted to use the median as our measure of central tendency to find which stations on each day during each time interval had the highest exiting foot traffic. \n"

    "Using all data from the year 2021, we began with 6488049 rows of data and 12 columns. However, after selecting each of the 59 MTA stations located inside the Bronx, we were left with 543581 rows of data. We selected stations by a combination of station and line name due to two stations having the same station name. I corrected for line name being reversed for some Yankee Stadium station data. Turnstile combinations of C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION, LINENAME were treated as unique turnstiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the central tendency for each station's turnstile per-hourly (~4) basis, the highest median was 272 mean (570). Due to the central tendencies and visualization, we set the counter limit to 5K per hourly data, per turnstile. Hourly exits were measured by subtracting a turnstile's exit data with the exit data that came immediately before. If the difference was negative, we took the absolute difference as the hourly exits. If the counter exceeded 5K, we set the hourly exits to whichever value (exits or previous exits) as the hourly exit. If the data were still above 5k, we set the exit to zero. Following this, we were left with 539912 rows Ã— 13 columns. Looking at the unfiltered data, we saw that the hourly exits exceeding 5K were below .0007%."
