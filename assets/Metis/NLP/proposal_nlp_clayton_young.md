# Unsupervised Learning and NLP

### Clayton Young

## Question/Need:

### What is the question behind your analysis? 

- Are there different groups commenting on Reddit news articles? 

### What is the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

- I plan on building an perform clustering analysis using NLP data from comments on a Reddit news article. 

### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

- Me! I'm going to use the Reddit API, which will allow me to get some experience using APIs. I'm also curious to see whether unsupervised learning is able to detect differences in the comments in what I'd consider a polarizing news article (e.g.,Rittenhouse trial). 


## Data Description:

### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

- I plan on using Reddit API to get comments off of a news article. 

### What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? 

- A unit will be a user's comment on the article. 

### What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

- I'll be working with text data in the user's comment.  


## If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

- I'll be performing a cluster analysis, so I'm unaware of my target.  

## Tools: 

### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

- I'll use NLTK to preprocess the data; Sklearn to create TF-IDFs/countvectors; 

### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

- Not sure yet, but that tends to be the case


## MVP Goal:

### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

- MVP would be preprocessing the data and getting it into a matrix
