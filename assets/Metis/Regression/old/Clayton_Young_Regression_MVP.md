Here is the model summary for now. So far, I've created dummy variables that I thought would be relevant (country, position, good/bad team). The model isn't great, so I'll likely add some more features and inspect more for colinearity. 
From what I have, it looks like being an attacker from one of the better teams increases predicts goals scored. There aren't many players from Oceania, so I'll have to get rid of those or find a way to weight them, since there aren't any players from Oceania that have been top goal scorer in the past ten years.
