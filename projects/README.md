Different works
----

This is where I'm hosting different works I've done separated by language. 

### [python](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/projects/python)
- This is where all of my Metis data science projects live. 

### [R](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/projects/R)
- Metacog, GARP, and some plotting.There's more in R I've done through lab, but I'll keep those in our private repo.

### [SQL](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/projects/sql)
- Most work here will be from interviews and other misc. challenges. I started off using SQlite but moved to PostgresQL, which has more functions. 

### [Business](https://github.com/ClaytonYoung/ClaytonYoung.github.io/tree/master/projects/Business)
- This project was for Metis. I used Tableau and some Excel (ew) as required. This module really taught me a lot about formatting and communication. So, while 
it may not be too technical, I'd like to store it.
