    "Utilizing the FBref website data, I landed on the idea of predicting the number of goals a player scores in a single Premier League season. Beyond individual player stats, I thought it'd also be interesting to scrape country GDP as a predictor since the PL is known for attracting players from across the world. Ultimately, I was left with only a handful of predictors that, when transformed, allowed the model to outcompete others with more variables."

    "My metric of interest is the number of non-penalty goals scored in a PL season. I decided upon non-penalty goals since it's a better representation of player skill and ability. I considered which variables available would accurately predict the number of goals a player scores in a season to target this metric. Aiming not to use predictor variables that had this answer within itself (e.g., conversion rate). I sought to use proxies for underlying characteristics (e.g., red cards for aggression). Additionally, I used player country data to see differences in player performance, as measured by the number of non-penalty goals scored, by country/region.\n",

    "First, I scraped all PL league data from the inception of the league to the present. However, as my project question shifted, I began scraping player data for each season. This included four pages of data per season (1992-present), and in total, ~65 columns of data per player, per season, located inside a dictionary with a key representing the year. Filtering included selecting data from the 2017-2018 season to 2021. This was due to missing data from the previous seasons. Pulling from Wikipedia and YourDicitonary, I matched country abbreviations in FBRef to each player's data, and after matching country, I scraped GDP data and matched it to each player. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although I was interested in county/continent and GDP and created an interaction variable, this proved detrimental to the model and was therefore dropped. Ultimately, I only kept 2091 rows and six columns for my entire dataset. The features kept were shots, position, team (also collapsed), and the interaction variable for positionXshots. \n",
