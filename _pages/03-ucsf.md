Academic research data is messy–this is a function of the high-turnover roles used to collect, organize, and analyze data. During the second half of my time at UCSF, I was brought in to make this process a little less painful for users of the data–I also wanted this process to be democratized. 

There were different parts to this process:

- Discovery of user needs and **a lot** of data 'archaeology'
    - Combing through a shared drive, the org database, data collection sources, and prior datasets 
    - Identifying missing IDs
      - Addressed root cause, created and shared [tutorial](/assets/Qualtrics_distributions.html) for fixing this
- Collaboration with users in defining a datapoint and implementing this logic
- Quality checks-surfacing inconsistencies in the incoming data
  - Walked data owners through inconsitencies in data with interactive examples and integrated fixed data
- 

I was given a list of instruments users of the data wanted which differed from the instruments found in the prior dataset. Tracking all of this down looked like this:
