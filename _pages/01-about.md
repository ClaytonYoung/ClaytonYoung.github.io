I am an Engineer currently developing a **neuroimaging web application** that leverages **AI/ML** for **biomarker discovery**.  We use user-uploaded and open-source data to fuel innovation within this field. I am also proficient in establishing and automating CI/CD pipelines for the deployment of applications on AWS using GitHub Actions.  

My expertise also includes setting up AWS infrastructure, including ECS, ECR, S3, RDS, and Route 53. I am skilled in integrating secure authentication using Django-allauth and React, which ensures both a good user experience and data protection. I am committed to creating user-friendly designs and use Tailwind CSS to build intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.

Before my current role, I worked as a Data Science Engineer, where I developed an interactive R Shiny application and R Markdown notebooks. These tools allowed researchers to efficiently generate, subset, and validate versioned datasets, cutting down processing time from years to minutes. I also collaborated with users to create interactive data dictionaries in order to promote data transparency and accessibility.  I enjoy fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, and this led me to train researchers on GitHub best practices, which enhanced version control and teamwork. 

My background also includes experience as a Research Coordinator focusing on **decision-making in dementia and neuroethics**.  I contributed to data analyses and visualizations, which resulted in four co-authored publications. My responsibilities in that role included administrative and logistical planning, supporting grant proposals, and managing research schedules. 

I earned my Bachelor's in Biopsychology, during which time I worked as a Research Assistant in two cognitive neuroscience labs. This early research involved using EEG to study visual working memory, attention, and language.
