I'm a data scientist currently ensuring UCSF's [Decision Lab](https://decisionlab.ucsf.edu) runs smoothly. My interests range from public health and governance to financial markets and cryptoâ€“-all of which can benefit from data science. 

I've recently bolstered my technical skills and interest in working with data by completing [Metis'](https://www.thisismetis.com/bootcamps/online-data-science-bootcamp) data science Bootcamp. My projects covered exploratory data analysis, linear regression, web scraping, classification, unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and business. 

I've spent the past few years in academia investigating decision-making in older adults and managing a lab with three different federally funded projects. Of equal importance, I've also helped develop a lab culture based on respect, kindness, and humor, which has weathered our team through an otherwise troubling pandemic. 

Enjoy using both R and Python!
