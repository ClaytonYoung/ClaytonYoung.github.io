[Exploratory Data Anlysis-turnstile calendar](EDA)
- Analyzed New York MTA data for a hypothetical taco truck business. The insights drawn from here allowed me to create a weekly calendar to capitalize on exiting foot traffic.

[Regression-prediction who will score the most goals](regression)
- For this project, I used Selenium to scrape a few different sites to predict the number of goals a player would score in a premier league season. Really fun project. Though, I wouldn't use linear regression for this type of problem in the future!

[Unsupervised NLP-sentiment analysis on crypto subreddit](unsupervisednlp)
- Used unsupervised learning to topic model Reddit comments from r/CryptoCurrency to see what's going on in an area that has a lot of traction at the moment. This was probably the most exciting one of the lot for me since I found myself scrolling through Reddit while sick when trying to come up with project ideas.

[dementia classification](classification)
- Using UCSF's Memory and Aging data (where I work), I wanted to build a dementia classification model. I built a few different models and tuned their hyperparameters using grid and randomized search cross-validation. This was a great real-world problem, and I'm lucky to have been able to use the data from work!
