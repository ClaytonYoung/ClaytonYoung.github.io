Below are links to projects I completed during my time Metis Data Science BootCamp back in 2021.

##[Unsupervised NLP – Sentiment Analysis on r/CryptoCurrency](unsupervisednlp)

**Goal:** Explore the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit to uncover key discussion topics and sentiment trends.

**Approach & Outcome:**

Implemented topic modeling on scraped Reddit comments to identify emerging themes and sentiments in the crypto space.
Gained insight into the community’s discussions, particularly around market trends, blockchain developments, and investment strategies.
Highlights:

Delved into the world of unsupervised learning, specifically topic modeling.
Balanced data exploration with a personal interest in cryptocurrency, turning a hobby into a project filled with exciting discoveries.


##[Classification – Dementia Classification](classification)

**Goal:** Use UCSF’s Memory and Aging data to build a predictive model for dementia.

**Approach & Outcome:**

Developed and tuned various classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the likelihood of dementia.
Employed grid search and randomized search cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
Highlights:

Tackled a real-world problem with direct societal impact, leveraging domain-specific data from my workplace.
Practiced advanced model selection, evaluation, and tuning techniques critical for production-ready machine learning applications.


##[Regression – Predicting Who Will Score the Most Goals](regression)

**Goal:** Use Selenium and other tools to scrape player statistics and predict the number of goals scored in a Premier League season.

**Approach & Outcome:**

Collected data from multiple soccer-related websites, then combined it into a cohesive dataset.
Built and trained a linear regression model, although in hindsight, a different algorithm may have been more appropriate for this type of prediction.
Highlights:

Discovered the intricacies of web scraping and data wrangling.
Learned that model selection and domain knowledge (in this case, sports analytics) are crucial for accurate predictions.


##[Exploratory Data Analysis – Turnstile Calendar](EDA)

**Goal:** Analyze New York MTA data for a hypothetical taco truck business.

**Approach & Outcome:**

Examined the MTA turnstile dataset to uncover foot traffic patterns across different times and stations.
Designed a weekly calendar to schedule optimal taco truck visits, effectively capitalizing on existing commuter traffic.
Highlights:

Learned to clean and merge large datasets efficiently.
Gained hands-on experience with exploratory techniques (e.g., data visualization and pivot tables) that guided business-focused decisions.


##[Business – Heart Disease Risk Dashboard](business)

**Goal:** Work with CDC’s NHIS 2019 dataset to outline demographic risk factors for heart disease.

**Approach & Outcome:**

Processed and analyzed health survey data to identify risk factors, including age, lifestyle habits, and pre-existing conditions.
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore how different variables correlate with heart disease risk.
Highlights:

Strengthened data visualization skills, particularly designing clear, intuitive dashboards.
Learned how domain knowledge (in this case, public health) informs data-driven insights and real-world solutions.
